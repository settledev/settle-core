### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! When proposing a new feature:

1. **Check the roadmap** to see if it's already planned
2. **Explain the use case** and why it would be valuable
3. **Consider the impact** on existing functionality
4. **Think about implementation** - is it feasible within our constraints?

## ü§ù Development Setup

   ```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Unit tests**: Run `go test ./...`
2. **Integration tests**: Test with real SSH connections
3. **Manual testing**: Try your changes with example configurations

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

type(scope): description
[optional body]
[optional footer]

Examples:

- `feat(cmd): add new ping command`
- `fix(core): resolve circular dependency issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the style guidelines
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Run tests** and ensure they pass
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Clear, concise description
- **Description**: Explain what and why (not how)
- **Related issues**: Link to any related issues
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
- **Breaking changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Key Components

- **`cmd/`**: CLI commands and user interface
- **`core/`**: Core engine, graph logic, and state management
- **`drivers/`**: Package managers and service implementations
- **`inventory/`**: Host management and SSH connectivity
- **`common/`**: Shared types and constants

### Adding New Resources

To add a new resource type:

1. **Define the resource** in `core/resources.go`
2. **Implement the driver** in `drivers/`
3. **Add parsing logic** in `core/parser.go`
4. **Update tests** and documentation
5. **Add examples** in `examples/`

### Adding New Commands

To add a new CLI command:

1. **Create the command** in `cmd/`
2. **Follow the existing pattern** using Cobra
3. **Add help text** and usage examples
4. **Update the root command** if needed
5. **Add tests** for the new command

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific test
go test ./cmd -run TestPingCommand
```

### Test Guidelines

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test with real SSH connections
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use interfaces for testability
- **Test error conditions**: Don't just test happy paths
- **Keep tests fast**: Avoid slow network calls in unit tests

## üìÑ Documentation
